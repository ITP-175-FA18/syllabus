# Welcome

Welcome to ITP 175! This module we'll

* get some of our tools setup
* get acquainted with each other
* touch the tip of the computer science iceberg

## Introducing most of the tools used in this course

Below are most of the core tools we'll use for this course. It isn't everything we'll use throughout the semester, but we'll add the others when they become necessary.

### Slack

Slack is our communication tool.

1. Visit [our signup page][1] and create an account with your myRCC email address.

    If you're new to Slack, read [What is Slack?][2] or watch [What is Slack?][3] on youtube

1. You've successfully joined our slack when you see a page like this. *If you are new to slack, you won't see the left-most sidebar with all the icons.*

    ![slack 1][27]

1. I recommend you install the desktop and mobile apps, but it is not required. The web app can always be found at [https://itp175fa18.slack.com][28]

### Github

Git is a popular version control software used by developers around the world. We'll learn more about how git works a little later.

1. Visit [https://github.com][4] and create an account with your myRCC email address.
1. Choose the `unlimited public repositories for free` option and click the green `Continue` button. You do not need to check either of the two checkboxes.

    ![Github signup 1][5]

1. Respond to the questions how you see fit, they are not used for this course.

    ![Github signup 2][6]

1. When you've completed sign up, you should see a screen like this and have an email asking you to verify your email address in your inbox. Click the link in that email to verify your address.

    ![Github signup 3][7]

1. Download [Github Desktop][17] and [follow the installation instructions][18]
1. [Authenticate to Github][19]
1. Github Desktop should install git on your machine during installation. Follow the [Configure Git for GitHub Desktop][20] instructions to finish the configuration process.

### Codecademy

Codecademy.com is a website for learning and practicing programming concepts and is a tool we'll be using frequently.

1. Visit [codecademy.com][21] and click the Github icon in the bottom-right corner to login with your Github account.

    ![cc signup 1][22]

1. Click the green `Authorize Codecademy` button and enter your Github password if asked.

    ![cc signup 2][23]

1. Codecademy really wants you to signup for their Pro service, which **is not required** for this course. Anytime you are asked to start a free trial, you can skip or exit out of that.
1. Click the black background to opt out of the Pro trial and you should see a screen like this

    ![cc signup 3][24]

1. Click the `Skip to Dashboard` button in the upper right and you'll be taken to your dashboard.

    ![cc signup 4][25]

1. Click the yellow/orange `Start` button on the Welcome to Codecademy! course. This course walks you through the codecademy interface. Be sure to click the X on the upgrade to Pro banner.

    ![cc signup 5][26]

1. The Welcome to Codecademy course does introduce some programming concepts. If you have trouble completing it, do not be discouraged, you are not required to have prior knowledge of programming to take ITP 175.

What is most important is that you understand how the codecademy interface works for when we use it to learn and practice concepts later.

### Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to write rich text documents that display nicely online. You will encounter it on github and glitch.

In fact, this page you're reading is written in Markdown. Visit [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITP-175-FA18/syllabus/master/00-welcome.md][11] to see what it looks like without formatting.

1. Go through [NCSU's Markdown Tutorial][13] to get comfortable.
