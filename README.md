## Teaching Philosophy
My objective as a professor is to be true to the meaning of the verb to profess. To affirm my allegiance to learning and my belief that constant life-long learning is a requirement in the world we live in. Specifically, my goal is to show people how technology has replaced the need to remember a lifetime of irrelevant facts and to spend their energy analyzing relevant information and applying critical thinking strategies to create solutions. In short we all need to be a modern Sherlock Holmes. 

I believe, the 21st century needs a generation of complex problem-solving strategists and molding that generation is a problem I’m attempting to solve. I will provide as much real life application as possible in every course I teach. I will create an environment where students learn from themselves, each other, and myself. I will engage students to use technology to their advantage at home, work, and in the classroom. I will challenge systems regularly to ensure there is no better way. I will lead by example.
