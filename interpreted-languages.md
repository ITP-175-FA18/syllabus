# Interpreted Languages

This module is all about taking those programming concepts and applying them to a specific language.

Javascript is the interpreted language we'll be spending time with in this course. Mozilla's [Javascript Basics][1] offers a nice and concise reference of the programming concepts covered this far and how to invoke them in Javascript.
