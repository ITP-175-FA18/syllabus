# Welcome
Welcome to ITP 175! This module we'll 

* get acquainted with each other
* get all of our tools setup
* touch the tip of the computer science iceberg

## Introducing the tools used in this course
### Slack
Slack is our communication tool. Visit [our signup page][1] and create an account with your myRCC email address. 

If you're new to Slack, read [What is Slack?][2] or watch [What is Slack?][3] on youtube

### Markdown
Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to write rich text documents that are converted to HTML and display nicely online. You aren't expected to know, but you may come across it on github and glitch.

This page you're reading is written in Markdown. Visit [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ITP-175-FA18/syllabus/master/00-welcome.md][11] to see what it looks like without formatting.

1. Go through [NCSU's Markdown Tutorial][13] to get comfortable.

#### Extra Resources
