# Chat 0 - Introductions

The purpose of this chat is to make sure you have joined our Slack workspace and give you a chance to chat in a `channel` which is viewable by the professor and students as well as in a `direct message` which is only viewable (private) by you and the person you are direct messaging.

1. 5pts - After joining the [ITP 175 FA18 Slack workspace][1] say hello to your classmates in the `#homeroom` channel.
1. 5pts - Typing the `@` character will allow you to mention or "at" someone using their username. Type a message to `@profmikegreene`. This will notify, and still allow others in the channel to see the message.
1. 5pts - The **+** button to the right of `Direct Messages` will bring up a window listing all the people in our workspace. Select profmikegreene from the list and send me a Direct Message.

You can always send me questions privately via email or Direct Message. But I encourage you to ask them in  `#q-and-a` so that you and your fellow students can help each other out. Programming does not have to be a solo sport!
