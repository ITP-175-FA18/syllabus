# Chat 1 - Learning about cool commands

The purpose of this chat is to begin using search techniques to help further your learning process and 

1. Search the web for lists of command line commands. Find one that seems particuly powerful, cool, intersting or useful and research how to use it.
2. Go to glitch, open the glitch console, use the command, take a screenshot
3. 5pts - After joining the [ITP 175 FA18 Slack workspace][1] say hello to your classmates in the `#homeroom` channel.
4. 5pts - Typing the `@` character will allow you to mention or "at" someone using their username. Type a message to `@profmikegreene`. This will notify, and still allow others in the channel to see the message.
5. 5pts - The **+** button to the right of `Direct Messages` will bring up a window listing all the people in our workspace. Select profmikegreene from the list and send me a Direct Message.

You can always send me questions privately via email or Direct Message. But I encourage you to ask them in  `#q-and-a` so that you and your fellow students can help each other out. Programming does not have to be a solo sport!
