### Glitch
Codecademy is great for learning and practicing new concepts, but it is purposefully limiting in what you can do. When we need more flexibility you'll use a site called [Glitch][8] to apply the knowledge you've been learning. 

Head to [https://glitch.com][8] and click the `Sign in` button in the upper right.
![Glitch signup 1][9]

Choose the `Sign in with Github` option and you'll be taken to the screen below. Click the green `Authorize FogCreek` button (FogCreek is the company who makes Glitch)
![Glitch signup 2][10]

You'll be redirected to the glitch homepage with an account ready for coding!

### Using the command line on your machine - terminal or powershell
