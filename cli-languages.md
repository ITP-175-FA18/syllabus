# Command Line Interface Languages

[Harvard CS50 command line overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnYKOnz9ln8)

1. Login and click the orange `START` button on [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line course][1]. There are 4 modules in this course:

* Navigating the File System
* Viewing and Changing the File System
* Redirecting Input and Output
* Configuring the Environment

Navigating the File System has 9 lessons which can be found by clicking the menu icon in the lower left hand corner of the codecademy screen.

In the [Navigation module][3], you'll learn about the following commands:

* `pwd` outputs the name of the current working directory.
* `ls` lists all files and directories in the working directory.
* `cd` switches you into the directory you specify.
* `mkdir` creates a new directory in the working directory.
* `touch` creates a new file inside the working directory.

After completing these 9 lessons click `Next` to move to the next module. Remember, you do **not** have to upgrade to codecademy pro.

In the [Manipulation module][4], you'll learn about:

* options that modify what `ls` and `cp` do
* how wildcards allow you to select groups of files or directories

## Introducing a new tool - Glitch

Codecademy is great for learning and practicing new concepts, but it is purposefully limiting in what you can do. When we need more flexibility you'll use a site called [Glitch][8] to apply the knowledge you've been learning.

1. Head to [https://glitch.com][8] and click the `Sign in` button in the upper right.

1. Choose the `Sign in with Github` option and you'll be taken to the screen below. Click the green `Authorize FogCreek` button (FogCreek is the company who makes Glitch). You'll be redirected to the glitch homepage with an account ready for coding!

    ![Glitch signup 2][10]

1. Click `New Project` then `hello-webpage` in the upper right corner and you'll be taken to the Glitch coding environment.

    ![Glitch signup 3][11]

    Notice, my project is called gutsy-gym. Yours will be called something different, this allows many people to create projects on glitch and share them with each other.

1. Click the `Logs` button near the upper left to open the console at the bottom of your browser.
1. There, you will see a `Console` button. Click this and a new window or tab will open with a command line for your project

    ![Glitch console][12]

1. Practice the commands you learned. If you get stuck, head back to glitch.com and create a new project to start over.
