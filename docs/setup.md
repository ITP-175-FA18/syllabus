# Technology Setup

This module we'll:

* get some of our tools setup
* get acquainted with each other
* touch the tip of the computer science iceberg :mount_fuji:

## :books: Tools used in this course

Below are most of the core tools we'll use for this course. It isn't everything we'll use throughout the semester, but we'll add the others when they become necessary.

### Slack

Slack is our communication tool for this course. It's used by teams in many industries and is quickly changing how teams communicate with each other.

1. Visit [our signup page][1] and create an account with your myRCC email address.

    If you're new to Slack, you can check out :book:[What is Slack?][2] or :tv:[What is Slack?][3].

1. You've successfully joined our slack when you see a page like this. *If you are new to slack, you won't see the left-most sidebar with all the icons. It only shows when you're in multiple teams.*

    ![slack 1][27]

1. I recommend you install the desktop and mobile apps, but it is not required. The web app can always be found at [https://rccitp175.slack.com][28]

### Github

Git is a popular version control software used by developers around the world. We'll learn more about how git works a little later.

1. Visit [https://github.com][4] and create an account with your myRCC email address.
1. Choose the `unlimited public repositories for free` option and click the green `Continue` button. You do not need to check either of the two checkboxes.

    ![Github signup 1][5]

1. Respond to the questions how you see fit, they are not used for this course.

    ![Github signup 2][6]

1. When you've completed sign up, you should see a screen like this and have an email asking you to verify your email address in your inbox. Click the link in that email to verify your address.

    ![Github signup 3][7]

### Codecademy

Codecademy.com is a website for learning and practicing programming concepts and is a tool we'll be using frequently.

1. Visit [codecademy.com][21] and click the Github icon in the bottom-right corner to login with your Github account.

    ![cc signup 1][22]

2. Click the green `Authorize Codecademy` button and enter your Github password if asked.

    ![cc signup 2][23]

3. Codecademy really wants you to signup for their Pro service, which is **NOT required** for this course. Anytime you are asked to sign up for Pro, you can skip or exit out of that.
4. Click the black background to opt out of the Pro trial and you should see a screen like this

    ![cc signup 3][24]

5. Click the `Skip to Dashboard` button in the upper right and you'll be taken to your dashboard.

    ![cc signup 4][25]

6. Click the yellow/orange `Start` button on the Welcome to Codecademy! course. This course walks you through the codecademy interface. Be sure to click the X on the upgrade to Pro banner.

    ![cc signup 5][26]

7. The Welcome to Codecademy course does introduce some programming concepts. If you have trouble completing it, do not be discouraged, you are not required to have prior knowledge of programming to take ITP 175.

What is most important is that you understand how the codecademy interface works for when we use it to learn and practice concepts later.

### Markdown

Markdown is a markup language that makes it easy to write rich text documents that display nicely online. You will encounter it on github and glitch.

In fact, this page you're reading is written in Markdown. Visit [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RCC-ITP-175/course/master/docs/1-setup.md][11] to see what it looks like without formatting.

1. Go through [NCSU's Markdown Tutorial][13] to get an introduction to the Markdown language.

### Glitch

Codecademy is great for learning and practicing new concepts, but it is purposefully limiting in what you can do. When we need more flexibility you'll use a site called [Glitch][30] to apply the knowledge you've been learning.

This is especially useful when learning the command line as typing the wrong command on your personal computer can do serious damage.

1. Head to [https://glitch.com][30] and click the `Sign in` button in the upper right.

    ![Glitch signup 1][31]

2. Choose the `Sign in with Github` option and you'll be taken to the screen below. Click the green `Authorize FogCreek` button (FogCreek is the company who makes Glitch). You'll be redirected to the glitch homepage with an account ready for coding!

    ![Glitch signup 2][32]

3. Click `New Project` then `hello-webpage` in the upper right corner and you'll be taken to the Glitch coding environment.

    ![Glitch signup 3][13]

    Notice, my project is called gutsy-gym. Yours will be called something different, this allows many people to create projects on glitch and share them with each other.

4. Click the `Logs` button near the upper left to open the console at the bottom of your browser.
5. There, you will see a `Console` button. Click this and a new window or tab will open with a command line for your project

    ![Glitch console][34]

6. Practice the commands you learned. If you get stuck, head back to glitch.com and create a new project to start over.

#### Extra Resources

* [Markdown-Cheatsheet][12] - text
* [Markdown Crash Course][16] - 20m video

## :speech_balloon: Chat 0

### Instructions
The purpose of this chat is to make sure you have joined our Slack workspace and give you a chance to use the three types of Slack messages

* a message in a `channel` which is viewable by the professor and students
* an `@` message in a `channel` which notifies the person you mentioned and is viewable by everyone in the `channel`
* a `direct message` which is private and only viewable by you and the person you are direct messaging

### Grading Rubric

| % | Explanation|
|-----|:--------|
| 25% | Join the [ITP 175 Slack workspace][28] |
| 25% | Say hello to your classmates in the `#homeroom` channel. |
| 25% | Join the [sp19-c0][29] channel and use `@profmikegreene` to mention me and ask a question you have about the course or programming. |
| 25% | Use the **+** button to the right of `Direct Messages` and select profmikegreene from the list to send me a Direct Message that you've been able to login. |

You can always send me questions privately via email or Direct Message. But I encourage you to ask them in  `#q-and-a` so that you and your fellow students can help each other out. Programming does not have to be a solo sport!
