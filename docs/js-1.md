# Programming Concepts

## :books: Watch and Read

In this module, we'll introduce the some fundamental concepts found in most modern languages including JavaScript which we'll be spending our time in for the rest of the course. Read each of the links below. They contain many links to other pages which you aren't required to read, but are welcome to if the topic peaks your interest.

[Computing Timeline][] useful for seeing the waves of programming languages and how they evolved from one another.

[Programming background][] covers the purpose of programming, programming languages, and some differences between programming languages.

[Organizing programs][] in a logical way helps both the computer and the programmers understand how the program works.

[Algorithms][] are the way you solve a problem in a program.

[Pseudocode][] is a way to plan your program using semi-natural language. It isn't a programming language, but a way for you to express what you want your code to do before you start writing it.

[Commenting code][] allows you to tell other programmers (or remind yourself) what a particular section of code does. Each language has its own syntax for comments and different projects will often declare standards for how to comment their code. Here's an example from the popular blogging platform [Wordpress][].
