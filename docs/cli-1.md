# CLI Languages

In this modules we'll introduce Command Line Interface (CLI) languages often referred to as shell or terminal programming.

## :books: Watch and Read

Watch the [Harvard CS50 command line overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnYKOnz9ln8)

### :repeat: Practice

1. Login and click the orange `START` button on [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line course][1]. Complete the first 2 modules in this course:

* Navigating the File System
* Viewing and Changing the File System

Navigating the File System has 9 lessons which can be found by clicking the menu icon in the lower left hand corner of the codecademy screen.
![Codecademy Menu][2]

In the [Navigation module][3], you'll learn about the following commands:

* `pwd` outputs the name of the current working directory.
* `ls` lists all files and directories in the working directory.
* `cd` switches you into the directory you specify.
* `mkdir` creates a new directory in the working directory.
* `touch` creates a new file inside the working directory.

After completing these 9 lessons click `Next` to move to the next module. 

:::tip No upgrade necessary
Remember, you do **not** have to upgrade to codecademy pro.
:::

In the [Manipulation module][4], you'll learn about:

* options that modify what `ls` and `cp` do
* how wildcards allow you to select groups of files or directories

### Play

Trying out CLI commands on your computer can be scary and potentially damaging to your computer. Use the Glitch terminal to play around with any linux commands you learn without any risk to your computer.

### Extra Resources

Because Windows is not based on Unix, there are several differences in how the Windows Command Prompt works compared to what you learned above. thenewboston has [a good Youtube playlist][13] that does over the Windows Command Prompt if you're a Windows user.

djangogirls.com has [a good resource][14] that takes the topics and shows them for Mac, Linux, and Windows side-by-side.

## :speech_balloon: Chat 1

### Instructions

The purpose of this chat is to begin developing your self-driven learning and collaboration skills both of which are critical for sustained growth in technical areas.

1. Search the web for resources with details on the commands you learned about this week.

    What you're looking for is a new way to use the command, a new argument (sometimes called variable), or a way to use it with other commands that wasn't covered in the codecademy lesson.

2. Go to glitch, open the glitch console, use the command, and take a screenshot of the result.

    [This post from Zapier][15] covers how to take screenshots on most platforms.

3. [Join the the `#chat-1` Slack channel][16] and share what you've learned and done.

### Grading Rubric

| % | Explanation|
|-----|:--------|
| 30% | Share a few sentences about what your command is doing and how it is different from what was covered in codecademy this week. |
| 10% | Share the URL of the resources you found earlier in step 1. |
| 10% | Share the screenshot of how you used the command in glitch during step 2. |
| 50% | Chat with your fellow students. Engage them on what you find interesting about their examples, get clarity on something you don't understand, offer help with others ask questions about your example. |

You can always send me questions privately via email or Direct Message. But I encourage you to ask them in  `#chat-1` so that you and your fellow students can help each other out. Programming does not have to be a solo sport!

## :memo: Journal 0

### Instructions

A common technique used by programmers when learning a new language or technique is to do something in a very basic way and call it "hello world".

This assignment introduces github and journaling for this course.

To complete this assignment:

1. Open up your favorite note taking app or website and create a new note. If you don't have a favorite, Microsoft Word, Notepad, or TextEdit will work just fine.

    >>Take all the notes you need to help get through the content and concepts presented this week. You do not need to change your normal note taking style for this assignment.

1. After you've gone through all the content for this week, at the bottom of your notes, add a section called "Reflections"
1. Here, write out two lists. One for the things you understand most confidently, and another for the things you are struggling with.

    >>The items in these lists can be vocabulary, tasks, concepts, whatever sticks out in your mind. Try to find at least two items per list and feel free to make them as long as you like. I will use these lists to check in with you next week on Slack.

1. Join the `0-hello-world` slack channel
1. In that Slack channel, you will see a link that will take you to Github Classroom

    You'll need to authorize Github Classroom the first time.

    ![Github Classroom Authorize][5]

1. Accept the `0-hello-world` assignment and Github will create a version of the project for you.

    ![Accept the assignment][6]
    ![Assignment setup][7]

1. Once this step is complete, visit [the Github homepage][8] and you should now see `ITP-175-FA18/0-hello-world` in the list on the left under Repositories.

::: tip
Reach out to the professor if you have issues getting to this stage. Do NOT Wait!!
:::

1. Click the `ITP-175-FA18/0-hello-world` repository and you will see a copy of these assignment instructions.
1. Click the green `Create new file` button on this page and name it `journal.md`.
1. In `journal.md` paste in the two lists from your Reflections.
1. Scroll down and you'll see a section called `Commit new file`. In the smaller textbox type, `create journal.md` and select the Commit directly to the `master` branch option.

    >>On github, a commit is like hitting a "save and upload" button. We'll learn more about version control soon.

1. Click the green `Commit new file` button.

| % | Explanation|
|-----|:--------|
