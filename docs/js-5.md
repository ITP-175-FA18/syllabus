1. Create a new Glitch project using the `Clone from Git Repo` option and paste in `RCC-ITP-175/sp19-08-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME` to clone from the repo you just created.

#### Javascript

1. Your Glitch project now contains several exercise.js files which contain instructions and some `console.log` statements to validate that you've completed the instructions.
1. Write some Javascript to complete the instructions for each of the exercise.js files.

#### Submission

1. Open the Glitch Tools menu in the bottom left, and select `Git, Import, and Export`
1. Click `Export to Github` and if asked type `RCC-ITP-175/sp19-08-`
