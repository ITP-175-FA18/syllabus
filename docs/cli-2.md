<div class="asn chat">

## :speech_balloon: 02 Chat

**Due: 02/18/19 9 AM**

### Instructions

The purpose of this chat is to practice reviewing new material and drawing lines between what you do and don't know.

1. Research the web and find an article showing how the command line is used in your desired career field.

   If your desired career field doesn't make use of the command line, you can substitute cybersecurity, engineering, or web development.

1. After reviewing the article, create two lists.
   1. One with any commands, techniques, or terms are used that we have not covered yet.
   1. And one with any commands, techniques, or terms that we have covered.

    You can stop adding items to either list if it reaches 5 items.

1. Join the the [#sp19-02-chat Slack channel][] and share the URL of your article and your two lists.
1. Find an article that covers how to use or work with one of the items on one of your classmates list of items we haven't covered yet.
1. Share your article in #sp19-02-chat and use an @ mention to notify the original poster of what you found.

### Grading Rubric

| % | Explanation|
|-----|:--------|
| 25% | Share the URL of the resource you found earlier in step 1. |
| 25% | Share the list of items the URL references that we've covered in class |
| 25% | Share the list of items the URL references that we haven't covered in class |
| 25% | Share the URL of an article that covers how to use one of the items on a classmate's list of items not yet covered in class. |
| +10% | Extra credit: Engage your fellow students on what you find interesting about their posts, get clarity on something you don't understand, offer help with others ask questions about your example. |

You can always send me questions privately via email, txt, or Direct Message. But I encourage you to ask them in  `#q-and-a` or in the channel for that assignment (like `#sp19-02-chat`) so that you and your fellow students can help each other out. Learning and programming are not solo sports!
